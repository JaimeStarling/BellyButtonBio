# BellyButtonBio
Module 12 Belly Button Biodiversity

This website is mainly for those who volunteered in a scientific study of bacteria cultures found in belly buttons. Volunteers can check their ID number in a drop-down menu to the left of the page, then, in a bar chart, get the Top Ten Bacteria found in the sample they provided, with added information below in a bubble chart. The gauge chart is a reminder of how many times they clean their belly button each week, or at least what they claimed! The volunteer can hover their mouse/pointer over the bar chart and bubble chart for even further details.
